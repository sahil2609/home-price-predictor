# Home Price Predictor

## About the project

A website made using HTML, CSS and Javascript to predict real state prices. It uses the machine learning model to do so. Pickle file is used to store the model.
Model is built using sklearn and linear regression and the bangalore home prices dataset from kaggle is used for the same.
Pyhton flask server is made to serve http requests by using the saved model.
Website is built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.
Data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. are used to build the model.
Technology and tools used in this project are:

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Python flask for http server
6. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
